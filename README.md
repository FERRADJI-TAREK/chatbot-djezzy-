# **INTELLIGENT CUSTOMER SUPPORT CHATBOT FOR DJEZZY**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an **intelligent chatbot** aimed at enhancing customer support at **Djezzy**, one of Algeria's leading telecommunications providers. Conducted as part of a practical internship within the company, it explores key aspects of **Generative AI**, including **fine-tuning large language models (LLMs)**, optimizing responses, and integrating a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**.  

## **Project Stages**  

### **1. Data Collection and Extraction**  
- Utilized **web scraping** techniques to extract relevant data from various online sources.  
- Preprocessed raw data to ensure quality and relevance before training.  

### **2. Data Processing and Preparation**  
- Cleaned, annotated, and structured data to optimize chatbot performance.  


### **3. Model Training and Optimization**  
- **Fine-tuned** a **Large Language Model (LLM)** on a **Djezzy-specific corpus**, ensuring accurate and context-aware responses.  
- Integrated a **RAG system**, combining **retrieval-based search and text generation**, to provide precise and contextualized answers based on company documents.  

### **4. Implementation and Deployment**  
- Developed a **user-friendly interface** for chatbot interactions.  


### **5. Performance Evaluation and Optimization**  
- Measured chatbot efficiency using **performance metrics** such as **precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- Adjusted and improved responses based on user feedback and test results to enhance customer experience.  

## **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates the impact of **Generative AI** in automating customer service. By combining **fine-tuned LLMs and a RAG system**, the chatbot provides **highly relevant** and **optimized** responses, improving customer interaction. By **reducing workload on support teams** and offering **instant assistance**, the chatbot significantly enhances the user experience.
